Client and AI for the card game Macao

rules
-----

Two or more players with deck of 52 cards. Each player is dealt 6 cards and one card left on top of a discard pile. In each turn, the next player needs to follow the top of the pile and can play:

- a card with the same head
- a card with the same suit
- a Jack

and his card becomes the next top of the pile.

The goal is to relieve all of one's cards in hand.

If a player plays a Jack he announces the next suite to follow, and the next player can follow with any card of that suite.

If a player plays an Ace or an 8 - the next player waits a turn (skipped).

If a player plays a 7 - the next player is dealt two cards from the deck, unless he also plays a 7 which raises the deal for the next player for two cards, and so on.

If a player does not have a valid card to play, or does not want to, he is dealt one card from the deck. If he still does not play a card - he misses turn.
